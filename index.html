    <P>I am a motivated and organized HR professional with a Diploma in Human Resources Management and practical experience gained through an in-service learnership at Louis Trichardt Hospital. I have a strong background in employee relations, recruitment, and talent development, and I'm confident in my ability to communicate effectively and handle sensitive information with discretion. I'm also a self-taught web developer, continuously learning and applying digital skills to support and improve workplace processes.
